# Repository agent rules

## Database migrations

- Never invent or reuse a numeric migration ID. `0001` through `0008` are frozen identifiers already applied to databases.
- Before adding any new migration, run `npm run db:migration:id -- <module> <description>` and use the generated ID exactly.
- Keep the migration in its owning module's migration array. Do not rename or reorder an applied migration.
- Run `npm run verify` before pushing. The migration registry check must pass; do not bypass duplicate, format or ordering failures.
